# Wolfenstein

29/04/2019 Update
Status :
Project has not begun yet...

Update notes :
This is the start of this project on Github. So far, not much has been done : a test program to try and work on raycasting (seems like it is working, though the code is unreadable...), and a rework program to try and make the project for real (not much added except the menu loop).
Both these programs were made on OSX and therefore may not compile on Windows and Linux...

Content :
- wolfnogit contains only a test file that was meant test the graphic thingy. R to make it rain, T to make it snow, WASD to move around.
- returntocastleoneohone contains the first try to rework this project into a real (and readable one). Depending on the team working, it will serve as a basis or be forgotten in the pool of old stuff behind the fridge.

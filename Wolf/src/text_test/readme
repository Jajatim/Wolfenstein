This is supposed to be some kind of writing library, check .h for functions.
Work is in progress, do not use until finished (except for testing, obviously).

How allow color changing ?
For now it is only black (with squares that need to be removed :p), with pink background that is supposed to become invisible.
Possible solutions : 
- Creating other images with different colors
- Creating manually the surface (SDL_DrawPoint or stuff like that)
- Selecting a certain number of colors and doing only them
- Setting a fixed and not transparent background (so the color is always readable)


Todo list : 
- Create flags (like centered, aligned left, aligned right, etc...)
- How to manage height or multilines ? Do we need to ? Fixed height and single line sounds ok...
- How to manage multi colors ? See above
- Error when dest is too small ? Or display it anyway ? Or min width ? Many questions...
- Redraw a better police cause this one sucks
- See if continuing with .bmp load type or if we switch to a manually drawn texture from a .txt police...
- Large text will eventually need to be broken and some kind of way to scroll up and down, but let's not thing about it for now...
